# Personal_AI
A personal, somewhat ambitious project for myself to work on to become familiarized with GitHub, practice Python, use new libraries and bring together several APIs and datasets in one project.

# Purpose
The two main purposes for this project are as follows:
    - To become more familiar with GitHub and version control in Python
    - To create a personalized assistant, training my own LLM on a small-scale, and adding day-to-day useful capabilities to it.

## Resources used:
- Python - as a main programming language
- Datasets - TBD
- Libraries - TBD
