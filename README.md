# Personal AI
A somewhat challenging project for us to use Machine Learning to develop our own facial recognition program, retrain an open-source LLM, and learn to use GitHub along the way.

# Purpose
The three main purposes for this project are as follows:
- To become more familiar with GitHub and version control in Python and VSCode
- To create a Facial Recognition program to identify people around us.
- To retrain an existing LLM for our own use-case

## Resources used:
- Python - as a main programming language
- Libraries - TBD
