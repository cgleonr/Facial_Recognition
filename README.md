# Personal AI
A somewhat challenging project for us to use Machine Learning to develop our own facial recognition program, retrain an open-source LLM, and learn to use GitHub along the way.

# Purpose
The three main purposes for this project are as follows:
- To become more familiar with GitHub and version control in Python and VSCode
- To create a Facial Recognition program to identify people around us.
- To retrain an existing LLM for our own use-case

## Resources used:
- Python - as a main programming language
- Libraries - TBD


## How To
### LLM
So far, the functions all work individually. However, you will need to download API keys for each of the APIs in use, and add them into the .env file accordingly.
#### online_ops
Currently, all functions here work properly, given good internet connection and a proper API key. Note, however, that the function for sending whatsapp messages currently only opens whatsapp web on your browser (you need to be logged in) and types the message, but does not send it.
